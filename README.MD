## Slack PHP SDK.

The Slack SDK for PHP is a library with powerful features that enable PHP developers to easily integrate Slack APIs.


*This is not an official package.*

Me personally actively use and maintain this package for a project https://thetopchat.com/.

The library is using Slack OAuth v2 only.

The library is unfinished and not ready to be used.
